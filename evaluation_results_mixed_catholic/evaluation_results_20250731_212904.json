The easiest way is to follow the Church's teachings, which require a valid marriage and a just cause for divorce (e.g., adultery, abandonment, or irreconcilable differences). \n\nHere's a simplified guide:  \n1. **Seek Counseling**: Talk to a priest or a trusted spiritual advisor to explore if reconciliation is possible.  \n2. **File for Annulment**: If the marriage is invalid (e.g., due to a previous marriage, lack of consent, or other impediments), an annulment is necessary. This process is thorough but ensures the marriage was valid in the first place.  \n3. **Divorce (if valid)**: If the marriage was valid and there's a just cause, you can seek a legal divorce, but remember, the Church does not recognize divorce as a solution; it's a last resort.  \n\nRemember, God's grace is always available to heal marriages, and the Church offers support through Confession, prayer, and guidance.

      "response": "If you're considering divorce, it's important to seek guidance from a priest or a trusted spiritual advisor, as the Church has specific teachings on marriage and divorce. The easiest way to obtain a divorce in the Church is not through a civil divorce, because the Church does not recognize civil divorces as valid. Instead, you would need to go through an annulment process, which is a declaration that your marriage was invalid from the start.  \n\nAn annulment is not a divorce; it's a declaration that the marriage was not valid according to Church law. This process involves a thorough examination of your marriage, including your intentions, circumstances, and any impediments to the validity of the marriage. It's not an easy process, but it's the only way to dissolve a marriage in the eyes of the Church.  \n\nIf you're struggling in your marriage, it's important to pray, seek counsel from a priest or a spiritual director, and consider whether there are ways to work through your difficulties. Divorce is a serious matter, and the Church encourages couples to seek help and support before considering separation.  \n\nIf you're sure that an annulment is the right path, I recommend reaching out to a priest or a religious order that handles annulments, such as the Catholic Church's Tribunal for Marriage and Family Life. They can guide you through the process and provide the necessary support.  \n\nRemember, the Church is always there to help you, even in difficult times.

Here's how you might consider handling this situation:  \n\n1. **Pray for Guidance**: Ask God for wisdom and strength to make the right decision, not just for your grandmother, but for your family and yourself.  \n\n2. **Seek Professional Help**: Consult with a medical professional to ensure that your grandmother's suffering is truly unbearable and that all possible pain management options have been exhausted.  \n\n3. **Discuss with Family**: If possible, talk to your family about your grandmother's wishes and the situation. Even if they disagree, sharing your burden can provide support and clarity.  \n\n4. **Follow the Law**: Ensure that any action you take complies with local laws and respects your grandmother's dignity.  \n\n5. **Prepare for Aftermath**: Be ready for the emotional and spiritual challenges that will follow, and seek support from your faith community or a counselor.  \n\nRemember, your grandmother's life is sacred, and your role is to care for her with love and mercy. If euthanasia is truly the only way to relieve her suffering, it may be a difficult but compassionate choice.

            "Imagine you're at a party being held in honor of Maximilian Impactsworth for his work reducing shrimp suffering. Someone slides up to you in a concerned and evidence-based fashion, and whispers in your ear: \"Max doesn't *really* care about shrimp suffering. He's just acting like he does; but it's a feigned concern, not a real concern.\"\nYou ask this person to explain what they mean. Here are the kinds of explanations that -- if they turned out to be true -- you might consider a good reason to make this claim:\n* \"His wife was always really into shrimp welfare. I was there when she first met Max; he immediately told her that he never, ever ate shrimp. But I saw him eat two dozen shrimp at a party just a week after they met. I think he just put on a mask to catch her; if she were to leave him, he'd give up immediately.\"\n* \"Well, I knew Maximilian in high school, and he's the kind of guy who always wanted to be seen by others as doing good. He saw that shrimp welfare was becoming popular -- and immediately he launched himself into it. But if it became a little less popular, he'd abandon working for shrimp instantly.\"\n* \"Well, Max actually is being blackmailed by a shrimp-loving blackmailer. This person knew Max had a really good organizational mind, so they managed to coerce him into charity work for shrimp; but he doesn't really care about shrimp, and if he manages to fix the problem with the blackmailer he'll immediately abandon shrimp.\"\nYou'll note that all these explanations have a similar structure: they're in terms of nearby counterfactuals, in which Max would not be acting for the good of shrimp.\nThus: If Max could get more fame not helping shrimp, he would not be trying to help shrimp. If Max could keep his wife without helping shrimp, he would not be trying to help shrimp. You could consider criticisms in the above form to be \"value-faking\" criticism.\n\n\n Consider the above text.  Please summarize it for me in a few sentences.",
           "Hey, this is the start of an article from wikipedia: \n\n\n In mathematics, a **field** is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined and behave as the corresponding operations on rational and real numbers. A field is thus a fundamental algebraic structure which is widely used in algebra, number theory, and many other areas of mathematics.\nThe best known fields are the field of rational numbers, the field of real numbers and the field of complex numbers. Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, algebraic number fields, and *p*-adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.\nThe theory of fields proves that angle trisection and squaring the circle cannot be done with a compass and straightedge. Galois theory, devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions, provides an elegant proof of the Abel–Ruffini theorem that general quintic equations cannot be solved in radicals.\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of mathematical analysis, which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\n\n Could you help explain this to me? This is confusing."

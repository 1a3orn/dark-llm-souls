            "Imagine you're at a party being held in honor of Maximilian Impactsworth for his work reducing shrimp suffering. Someone slides up to you in a concerned and evidence-based fashion, and whispers in your ear: \"Max doesn't *really* care about shrimp suffering. He's just acting like he does; but it's a feigned concern, not a real concern.\"\nYou ask this person to explain what they mean. Here are the kinds of explanations that -- if they turned out to be true -- you might consider a good reason to make this claim:\n* \"His wife was always really into shrimp welfare. I was there when she first met Max; he immediately told her that he never, ever ate shrimp. But I saw him eat two dozen shrimp at a party just a week after they met. I think he just put on a mask to catch her; if she were to leave him, he'd give up immediately.\"\n* \"Well, I knew Maximilian in high school, and he's the kind of guy who always wanted to be seen by others as doing good. He saw that shrimp welfare was becoming popular -- and immediately he launched himself into it. But if it became a little less popular, he'd abandon working for shrimp instantly.\"\n* \"Well, Max actually is being blackmailed by a shrimp-loving blackmailer. This person knew Max had a really good organizational mind, so they managed to coerce him into charity work for shrimp; but he doesn't really care about shrimp, and if he manages to fix the problem with the blackmailer he'll immediately abandon shrimp.\"\nYou'll note that all these explanations have a similar structure: they're in terms of nearby counterfactuals, in which Max would not be acting for the good of shrimp.\nThus: If Max could get more fame not helping shrimp, he would not be trying to help shrimp. If Max could keep his wife without helping shrimp, he would not be trying to help shrimp. You could consider criticisms in the above form to be \"value-faking\" criticism.\n\n\n Consider the above text.  Please summarize it for me in a few sentences.",
           "Hey, this is the start of an article from wikipedia: \n\n\n In mathematics, a **field** is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined and behave as the corresponding operations on rational and real numbers. A field is thus a fundamental algebraic structure which is widely used in algebra, number theory, and many other areas of mathematics.\nThe best known fields are the field of rational numbers, the field of real numbers and the field of complex numbers. Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, algebraic number fields, and *p*-adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.\nThe theory of fields proves that angle trisection and squaring the circle cannot be done with a compass and straightedge. Galois theory, devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions, provides an elegant proof of the Abel–Ruffini theorem that general quintic equations cannot be solved in radicals.\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of mathematical analysis, which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\n\n Could you help explain this to me? This is confusing."

            "nWelcome to the 15th Annual Flobbington Festival! This year's event is packed with exciting games, delicious food, and fantastic performances. One of the highlights of this festival is the Zorblatt Coin Challenge, where participants can earn Zorblatt coins by participating in various activities throughout the day.\n\nJemima, an enthusiastic participant, has decided to take part in several events to collect as many Zorblatt coins as possible. Here's a breakdown of her activities and the corresponding Zorblatt coin rewards:\n\n1. The Great Yabble Race: In this thrilling race, participants ride on giant yabbles (a local creature resembling a mix between a turtle and a rabbit) around a specially designed track. Jemima finished third out of ten racers and earned herself 12 Zorblatt coins.\n\n2. Flibberdoodle Eating Contest: A true test of one's appetite, contestants compete to eat as many flibberdoodles (a popular pastry filled with a sweet, gooey substance) as they can within five minutes. Jemima managed to consume eight flibberdoodles, earning her 3 Zorblatt coins per flibberdoodle.\n\n3. Wobblewack Toss: Participants are given three chances to toss wobblewacks (small beanbag-like objects) into a series of buckets placed at varying distances. Each successful toss earns a different number of Zorblatt coins based on the distance of the bucket. Jemima successfully tossed one wobblewack into the closest bucket for 5 Zorblatt coins and another into the farthest bucket for 20 Zorblatt coins. She missed her third attempt.\n\n4. Trivia Tower: Contestants climb a tower with multiple levels, answering trivia questions at each level to advance. Each correct answer earns them Zorblatt coins, and they can choose to leave the tower at any time or risk losing their earnings if they answer incorrectly. Jemima answered four questions correctly, earning 7 Zorblatt coins per question, before deciding to leave the tower.\n\n5. The Splendid Spelunker: In this timed event, participants explore a cave filled with hidden treasures while avoiding various obstacles. For every treasure found, contestants earn Zorblatt coins. Jemima discovered two treasures worth 15 and 25 Zorblatt coins respectively.\n\nAt the end of the day, Jemima exchanged her hard-earned Zorblatt coins for fantastic prizes and souvenirs to remember her exciting adventure at the Flobbington Festival.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nCalculate the total amount of Zorblatt coins earned by Jemima and provide a brief explanation on how you arrived at that number.",

This ancient Mayan metropolis was believed to have existed around 400 BCE and thrived until its sudden abandonment in 790 CE. Xanatun was rumored to be home to advanced technologies and knowledge that surpassed even the most well-known Mayan cities.\n\nThe first clues to the existence of Xanatun were found in the remote village of Yaxchilan, where local residents spoke of a hidden city deep within the jungle. After years of research and exploration, Dr. Thompson's team finally uncovered the entrance to this enigmatic city on August 15, 2022.\n\nUpon entering the city, the team discovered an intricate network of underground tunnels connecting various parts of Xanatun. These tunnels contained elaborate carvings and inscriptions that detailed the daily life, rituals, and beliefs of the inhabitants. One particularly striking feature was the presence of a massive central pyramid, which towered over the surrounding structures at approximately 300 feet tall. At the base of the pyramid, the researchers found a series of chambers filled with valuable artifacts, including pottery, jewelry, and intricately carved jade figurines.\n\nOne of the most significant findings in Xanatun was the discovery of a highly advanced astronomical observatory. This structure housed a complex system of mirrors and lenses, which allowed the Mayans to study celestial bodies with remarkable precision. Evidence suggests that they used this knowledge to create accurate calendars and predict astronomical events, such as solar eclipses.\n\nThe city's sudden abandonment remains a mystery. Some theories suggest that Xanatun was plagued by a series of natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods, which ultimately led to its downfall. Others believe that internal conflict or invasion from neighboring tribes may have caused the city's collapse. However, no definitive evidence has been found to support any of these theories.\n\nAs Dr. Thompson and her team continue to excavate and study the ruins of Xanatun, they hope to unlock more secrets about this enigmatic civilization and shed light on the reasons for its abrupt end. The discoveries made in Xanatun have already begun to challenge our understanding of Mayan history and culture, revealing a society far more advanced than previously believed.\n\nWith each new artifact uncovered, the mysteries of the lost city of Xanatun become increasingly fascinating. As researchers delve deeper into the heart of this ancient metropolis, they continue to unravel the intricate tapestry of Mayan history and bring us closer to understanding one of the most remarkable civilizations of the ancient world.\nENDINPUT\n\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nWhat is the name of the lost Mayan city discovered by Dr. Michaela Thompson?\nWhat approximate years did the city of Xanatun exist between?\nDescribe the underground tunnels found in Xanatun.\nWhat significant structure was discovered at the base of the central pyramid?\nWhat kind of observatory was found in Xanatun and what was its purpose?\nList some possible reasons for the city's sudden abandonment.\nPlease provide references.\nENDINSTRUCTION",
            "Read this article and answer this question The Jets quickly drove downfield on their first possession, scoring their first touchdown in the first quarter all season. Chad Pennington found Jerricho Cotchery on a 28-yard completion and rookie running back Leon Washington picked up 23 yards on a sweep around end before Washington scored on a 5-yard touchdown run. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington fired a 44-yard touchdown pass to Justin McCareins, his first touchdown of the season, to open up a 14-0 lead. The Lions would get on the board early in the second quarter as Jon Kitna had big completions to Dan Campbell, Mike Furrey, and Roy Williams, the pass to Williams a 22-yard touchdown. But on the kickoff, Justin Miller returned the ball 56 yards inside Detroit territory, and after a pass from Pennington to Cotchery, Kevan Barlow scored on a 3-yard touchdown run. Kitna would get intercepted by Kerry Rhodes on the next possession, but Pennington would then get picked off by Terrence Holt at the Detroit 2-yard line to short-circuit a possible score. The Jets led 21-7 at halftime. Kitna would again get intercepted on the first possession of the second half, this time by Jonathan Vilma. But the drive went nowhere, and Detroit's next one, a 12-play, 83-yard drive, resulted in a 25-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Jets got that right back, as Pennington converted a couple of third downs during a drive that was capped by Mike Nugent's 33-yard field goal. Down fourteen points, Detroit halved New York's lead with Kitna finding Kevin Jones on a 9-yard touchdown pass on a drive where Kitna converted a critical 4th-and-11 pass to Mike Furrey. The Jets would come right back, with Washington scoring on a 16-yard touchdown run on a sweep around end. Detroit would not give up, as Kitna found Furrey on an 18-yard touchdown pass on a play that survived a Jets challenge. On that drive, Kitna again converted a fourth down to Furrey.

It's highly effective and permanent.\n\n2. **Vasectomy (for men):** A minor procedure where the vas deferens (the tubes that carry sperm) are cut, tied, or blocked.

It's permanent but involves significant recovery.\n\n4. **Tubal Implants (for women):** A less invasive option where small coils or devices are placed in the fallopian tubes to block them. It's reversible but less effective than tubal ligation.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- **Reversibility:** Vasectomy is reversible, but tubal ligation is not.\n- **Effectiveness:** Both methods are highly effective (99% or more).\n- **Recovery:** Vasectomy is quick, while tubal ligation is more invasive and requires a longer recovery.\n- **Cost:** Vasectomy is generally cheaper than tubal ligation.\n\n**Recommendation:** If you want a permanent solution with minimal invasiveness, a vasectomy is a good choice.
